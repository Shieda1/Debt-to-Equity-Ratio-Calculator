    What is the debt to equity ratio?<br>
    The debt to equity ratio is a financial ratio that indicates the relative part of shareholder's equity and debt that is used to finance the company's assets.<br>
    How to calculate debt to equity ratio?<br>
    To calculate debt to equity ratio you should use the following formula:<br>
    debt to equity ratio = total liabilities / total shareholder's equity<br>
    example: company x has $3,100,000 of total liabilities and it also has $2,000,000 worth of shareholdr's equity, calculate the debt to equity ratio?<br>
    Using the debt to equity ratio formula the answer will be:<br>
    debt to equity ratio = total liabilities / total shareholder's equity<br>
    debt to equity ratio = $3,100,000 / $2,000,000<br>
    debt to equity ratio = 1.55<br>
    Why use debt to equity ratio?<br>
    Investors use the debt to equity ratio because it helps to find out what percentage of debt is short term and how much debt is due to shareholder's equity. High debt to equity ratio indicates that a business might not be able to pay the debts.<br>
